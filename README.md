This is **Text-Image based Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant Project**. The Project is **MultiModality Project. **

**In text based nutrition,** the User need to provide their personal Preferences to get proper tailored nutrion menu in terms of breakfast, lunch, dinner along with nutrition details in the food. 

**In Image based nutrition analysis,** we can either place any food image URL in **JPG/PNG/JPEG** format or Upload the Food Image(**JPG/PNG/JPEG**) itself from local drive. In either of the cases, the Food Image will be displayed and then click on **Analyze Nutrition button** which is there below the Image. Click on the button then detailed analysis about the Food will be analyzed in terms on nutritional values, how to consume the food(regurlarly or occationally). Thus this Project provides personalized diet plan for the user and also analyzes the food he preferred to consume. **The Project is working Marvellously**.

Please **Refer requirements.txt** file for the Procedure to execute the Project.

**Note:**
This Project is developed on python 3.11 version. You also use the same python version for better results.
